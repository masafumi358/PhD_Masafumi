Phylogenetic Model for the Evolution of Carnivorous Plant Traps + Ancestral Character Estimation

We built phylogenetic models to test evolutionary hypotheses about the origin of carnivorous plant traps, with a focus on Utricularia. Using comparative models and stochastic mapping, it evaluates stepwise evolutionary scenarios—such as the “pitcher hypothesis”—within a statistical model comparison framework.
